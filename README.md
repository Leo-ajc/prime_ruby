# Coding exercise - Prime tables 
##### Ruby 2.2.4p230

## Introduction
Write an application that takes numeric input (N) from a user and outputs a multiplication table of (N) prime numbers.

## Install
`git clone https://github.com/Leo-ajc/prime_ruby.git`

`cd prime_ruby`

`bundle install`

## Run 
```
> ruby bin/find_n_primes 7                                
+----+----+----+----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|    | 2  | 3  | 5  | 7   | 11  | 13  | 17  |
| 2  | 4  | 6  | 10 | 14  | 22  | 26  | 34  |
| 3  | 6  | 9  | 15 | 21  | 33  | 39  | 51  |
| 5  | 10 | 15 | 25 | 35  | 55  | 65  | 85  |
| 7  | 14 | 21 | 35 | 49  | 77  | 91  | 119 |
| 11 | 22 | 33 | 55 | 77  | 121 | 143 | 187 |
| 13 | 26 | 39 | 65 | 91  | 143 | 169 | 221 |
| 17 | 34 | 51 | 85 | 119 | 187 | 221 | 289 |
+----+----+----+----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
```

## Run tests
`rspec spec`

## Benchmark
`ruby ./benchmark/benchmark.rb`

### Dataset
`./benchmark/regression_worksheet.xlsx`

### Limit of the function

![Big O Chart](./benchmark/big_o_chart.png)

> n = 1000
>
> O(n^c) Fractional Power
>
> y = 442726x^(0.8879)
>
> R^2 = 0.96254

#### Other limits
> n = 1000
> 
> O(n) Linear
> 
> y = 506076x + 6065.7
> 
> R^2 = 0.85404

> n = 1000
> 
> O(log n) Logarithmic
> 
> y = 22241ln(x) + 112255
>
> R^2 = 0.70307

## I am pleased with
Ruby is a nice language. I like working with it. The segmented sieve was challenging. 

## Given more time I would
Have integrated the segmented sieve with the multiplication table. I understand that separating the prime number generating code and the grid generating code means there were some double calculations of the sieved elements.
